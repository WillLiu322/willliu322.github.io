Hello! I’m Wei Liu (刘威), a Master’s student in Control Engineering at [Northeastern University](https://www.neu.edu.cn/), China, under the supervision of [Prof. Zhenyu Gao](https://graduate.neuq.edu.cn/info/1136/3299.htm) and [Prof. Ge Guo](https://graduate.neuq.edu.cn/info/1402/5316.htm). My research focuses on control theory and its application to vehicle platoon systems, where I developed advanced algorithms to bolster safety and performance in connected formations. 

I currently serve as a Research Assistant at [Central South University](https://www.csu.edu.cn/), focusing on hardware design, ROS development, and simulation using NVIDIA Isaac Sim.

Looking ahead, I intend to advance my work in embodied intelligence—creating practical solutions for intelligent driving and robotics that can be deployed in real‑world environments.

For academic exchanges or collaboration, please feel free to contact me at [2372288@stu.neu.edu.cn](mailto:2372288@stu.neu.edu.cn).
