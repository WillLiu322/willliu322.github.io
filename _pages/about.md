Hello! I'm Wei Liu (刘威), a Master's student in Control Engineering at [Northeastern University](https://www.neu.edu.cn/), China, advised by [Prof. Zhenyu Gao](https://graduate.neuq.edu.cn/info/1136/3299.htm) and [Prof. Ge Guo](https://graduate.neuq.edu.cn/info/1402/5316.htm). My research centers on control theory and its application to vehicle platoon systems, developing advanced algorithms to enhance the safety and performance of connected formations.

Next, I will go to [HKUST (GZ)](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/zh/?variant=zh-cn) to work as a three-month research assistant, focusing on the application of control theory and reinforcement learning in the field of intelligent transportation.

My future ambition is to contribute to embodied intelligence, creating practical and deployable solutions for intelligent driving and robotics in real-world scenarios.

I welcome academic exchanges or collaborations; please feel free to reach out at [2372288@stu.neu.edu.cn](mailto:2372288@stu.neu.edu.cn).
