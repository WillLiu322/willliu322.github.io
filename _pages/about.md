Hello! I'm Wei Liu (刘威), a Master's student in Control Engineering at [Northeastern University](https://www.neu.edu.cn/), China, advised by [Prof. Zhenyu Gao](https://graduate.neuq.edu.cn/info/1136/3299.htm) and [Prof. Ge Guo](https://graduate.neuq.edu.cn/info/1402/5316.htm). My research centers on control theory and its application to vehicle platoon systems, developing advanced algorithms to enhance the safety and performance of connected formations.

I currently serve as a Research Assistant at [Central South University](https://www.csu.edu.cn/), focusing on hardware design, ROS development, and simulation using Isaac Sim.

My future ambition is to contribute to embodied intelligence, creating practical and deployable solutions for intelligent driving and robotics in real-world scenarios.

I welcome academic exchanges or collaborations; please feel free to reach out at [2372288@stu.neu.edu.cn](mailto:2372288@stu.neu.edu.cn).
