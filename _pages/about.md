Hello! I'm Wei Liu (刘威), a Master's student in Control Engineering at [Northeastern University](https://www.neu.edu.cn/), China, advised by [Prof. Zhenyu Gao](https://graduate.neuq.edu.cn/info/1136/3299.htm) and [Prof. Ge Guo](https://graduate.neuq.edu.cn/info/1402/5316.htm). My research centers on control theory and its application to vehicle platoon systems, developing advanced algorithms to enhance the safety and performance of connected formations.

Looking ahead, I hope to break free from rigid methodological frameworks, prioritizing problem-driven, impactful research and the development of actionable solutions for real-world scenarios.

I welcome academic exchanges or collaborations; please feel free to reach out at [liuw8@mails.neu.edu.cn](mailto:liuw8@mails.neu.edu.cn).
